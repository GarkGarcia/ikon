A simple solution for encoding common icon file-formats, such as `.ico`, `.icns` and _favicon_. 

This crate is mostly a wrapper for other libraries, unifying existing APIs into a single, cohesive
interface. It serves as **[IconPie's](https://github.com/GarkGarcia/icon-pie)** internal library.

# Overview

An _icon_ consists of a map between _keys_ and _images_. An _entry_ is a _key-value_ pair contained
in an _icon_.

**IconBaker** simply automates the process of re-scaling _images_, creating _entries_ and combining
them into an _icon_.

## Keys

Each _icon_ format is associated with a particular _key type_, which determines how
_entries_ are labeled. Each _key_ can only be associated with a single _image_.

For example, _icon_ formats that only differentiate _entries_ by the dimensions of their associated
_images_ are labeled by _positive integers_, such as the `.ico` and `.icns` file-formats.

On the other hand, _icon_ formats that distinguish their _entries_ by 
_[path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29)_, such as _png sequeces_ and
_[FreeDesktop icon themes](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html)_
, are labeled by _path_.

Note that, since the dimensions
of the _images_ contained in an _entry_ are dictated by their associated _entries_, every _key_
must be convertible to a _positive integers_. Therefore, all _key types_ are required to implement
`AsRef<u32>`.

## Resampling

Pictures are scaled using resampling filters, which are represented by _functions that take a source_ 
_image and a size and return a re-scaled image_.

This allows the users of this crate to provide their custom resampling filters. Common resampling 
filters are provided in the 
[`resample`](https://docs.rs/icon_baker/2.2.0/icon_baker/resample/index.html) module.

# Examples

## General Usage

The `Icon::add_entry` can be used to automatically resample
_source images_ and converts them to _entries_ in an icon.

```rust
use icon_baker::{ico::{Ico, Key}, Image, Icon, IconError};

fn example() -> Result<(), IconError> {
    let icon = Ico::new();
    let src = Image::open("image.svg")?;

    icon.add_entry(resample::linear, &img, Key(32))
}
```

## Writing to Disk

Implementors of the `Icon` trait can be written to any object
that implements `io::Write` with the `Icon::write` method.

```rust
use icon_baker::favicon::Favicon;
use std::{io, fs::File};
 
fn example() -> io::Result<()> {
    let icon = Favicon::new();

    // Process the icon ...

    let file = File::create("out.icns")?;
    icon.write(file)
}
```

Alternatively, icons can be directly written to a file on
disk with `Icon::save` method.

```rust
use icon_baker::favicon::Favicon;
use std::{io, fs::File};
 
fn example() -> io::Result<()> {
    let icon = Favicon::new();

    /* Process the icon */

    icon.save("./output/")
}
```

# Support

**IconBaker** uses [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image) for _raster graphics_ manipulations and 
[`resvg`](https://crates.io/crates/resvg) with the [`raqote`](https://crates.io/crates/raqote) backend
for `svg` rasterization.

Note that some _file formats_ supported by `image` were explicitly left out of `icon_baker` because
they were considered irrelevant to the library's domain.

|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `png`  | All supported color types                                              | 
| `jpeg` | Baseline and progressive                                               | 
| `gif`  | Yes                                                                    | 
| `bmp`  | Yes                                                                    |

# Build Requirements

**IconBaker** relies on [`harfbuzz_rs`](https://crates.io/crates/harfbuzz_rs), wich means
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required to installed on the system for it build.

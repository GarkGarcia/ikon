A robust, flexible framework for creating encoders and decoders for various _icon formats_.

# Overview

**Ikon** is intended to be used as a framework for developers interested in creating encoders and decoders
for _various icon formats_ such as `.ico` files and _favicon_ schemes. It **does not** come with any encoders
or decoders out of the box.

Instead, it simply automates much of the hard work of _encoding_, _decoding_ and _resampling_ different
_[image formats](#Support)_, as well as provides powerfull abstractions, allowing developers to concentrate
on the more relevant problems.

_Icons_ are represented as maps between _keys_ and _images_. An _entry_ is a _key-value_ pair contained
in an _icon_. The type of the _keys_ of an _icon_ is what determines how it can be indexed. 

## Keys

Each _icon_ format is associated with a particular type of _key_. The type of the _keys_ of an _icon_ is
what determines how it can be indexed. Each _key_ can only be associated with a single _image_.

Since the _keys_ of an icon also encode information about the dimensions of it's associated _image_,
`Encoder::Key` and `Decoder::Key` are required to implement `AsSize`.

## Resampling

Raster graphics are scaled using resampling filters, which are represented by _functions that take a_
_source image and a size and return a re-scaled image_.

This allows the users of `ikon` and any of it's dependant crates to provide their custom resampling
filters. Common resampling filters are provided in the
[`resample`](https://docs.rs/ikon/ikon/resample/index.html) module.

# Support

**Ikon** uses [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image) for _raster graphics_ manipulations and 
[`resvg`](https://crates.io/crates/resvg) with the [`raqote`](https://crates.io/crates/raqote) backend
for `svg` rasterization.

Note that some _file formats_ supported by `image` were explicitly left out of `ikon` because
they were considered irrelevant to the library's domain.

| Format | Supported?                                                             | 
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `png`  | All supported color types                                              | 
| `jpeg` | Baseline and progressive                                               | 
| `gif`  | Yes                                                                    | 
| `bmp`  | Yes                                                                    | 
| `webp` | Lossy(Luma channel only)                                               | 
| `svg`  | [Static SVG Full 1.1](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg#svg-support) |

# Build Requirements

**Ikon** relies on [`harfbuzz_rs`](https://crates.io/crates/harfbuzz_rs), wich means
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required to be installed for it build.

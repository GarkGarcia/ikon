A robust, flexible framework for creating encoders and decoders for various 
_icon formats_.

# Overview

**Ikon** is intended to be used as a framework for developers interested 
in creating encoders and decoders for _various icon formats_ such as `.ico` 
files and _favicon_ schemes. It **does not** come with any encoders or 
decoders out of the box.

Instead, it simply automates much of the hard work of _encoding_, 
_decoding_ and _resampling_ different _image formats_, as well as provides 
powerfull abstractions, allowing developers to concentrate on the more
relevant problems.

_Icon families_ are represented as maps between _icons_ and _images_.The 
type of the _icons_ of an _icon_ is what determines how it can be 
indexed. 

## Icons

Each _icon format_ is associated with a particular type of _icon_. The type 
of the _icons_ of an _icon family_ is what determines how it can be indexed. 
Each _icon_ can only be associated with a single _image_.

## Resampling

Raster graphics are scaled using resampling filters, which are represented 
by _functions that take a source image and a size and return a re-scaled_ 
_image_.

This allows the users of `ikon` and any of it's dependant crates to provide 
their custom resampling filters. Common resampling filters are provided in 
the
[`resample`](https://docs.rs/ikon/0.1.0-beta.15/ikon/resample/index.html) 
module. The `resample` module also exposes the `resample::apply` function, 
which applies a resampling filter to an _image_ and checks if the outputted 
result matches the dimensions specified by the filter's arguments.

# Supported Image Formats

**Ikon** uses [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image) for _raster graphics_ 
manipulations and [`resvg`](https://crates.io/crates/resvg) with the 
[`raqote`](https://crates.io/crates/raqote) backend for `svg` rasterization.

Note that some _file formats_ supported by `image` were explicitly left out of 
`ikon` because they were considered irrelevant to the library's domain.

| Format | Supported?                                                             | 
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `png`  | All supported color types                                              | 
| `jpeg` | Baseline and progressive                                               | 
| `gif`  | Yes                                                                    | 
| `bmp`  | Yes                                                                    | 
| `webp` | Lossy(Luma channel only)                                               | 
| `svg`  | [Static SVG Full 1.1](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg#svg-support) |

# Build Requirements

**Ikon** relies on [`harfbuzz_rs`](https://crates.io/crates/harfbuzz_rs), wich 
means [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required to be installed for it build.

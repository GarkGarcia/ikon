A robust, flexible framework for creating encoders and decoders for various _icon formats_.

# Overview

An _icon_ consists of a map between _keys_ and _images_. An _entry_ is a _key-value_ pair contained
in an _icon_.

**Ikon** simply automates the process of re-scaling _images_, creating _entries_ and combining
them into an _icon_.

## Keys

Each _icon_ format is associated with a particular _key type_, which determines how
_entries_ are labeled. Each _key_ can only be associated with a single _image_.

For example, _icon_ formats that only differentiate _entries_ by the dimensions of their associated
_images_ are labeled by _positive integers_, such as the `.ico` and `.icns` file-formats.

On the other hand, _icon_ formats that distinguish their _entries_ by 
_[path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29)_, such as
_[FreeDesktop icon themes](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html)_
, are labeled by _path_.

Note that, since the dimensions of the _images_ contained in an _entry_ are dictated by their
associated _entries_, every _key_ must be convertible to a _positive integers_. Therefore, all
_key types_ are required to implement `AsSize`.

## Resampling

Pictures are scaled using resampling filters, which are represented by _functions that take a source_ 
_image and a size and return a re-scaled image_.

This allows the users of this crate to provide their custom resampling filters. Common resampling 
filters are provided in the [`resample`](https://docs.rs/ikon/ikon/resample/index.html) module.

# Support

**Ikon** uses [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image) for _raster graphics_ manipulations and 
[`resvg`](https://crates.io/crates/resvg) with the [`raqote`](https://crates.io/crates/raqote) backend
for `svg` rasterization.

Note that some _file formats_ supported by `image` were explicitly left out of `ikon` because
they were considered irrelevant to the library's domain.

| Format | Supported?                                                             | 
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `png`  | All supported color types                                              | 
| `jpeg` | Baseline and progressive                                               | 
| `gif`  | Yes                                                                    | 
| `bmp`  | Yes                                                                    |

# Build Requirements

**Ikon** relies on [`harfbuzz_rs`](https://crates.io/crates/harfbuzz_rs), wich means
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required to be installed for it build.

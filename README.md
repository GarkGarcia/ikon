A simple solution for encoding common icon file-formats, such as `.ico`, `.icns` and _favicon_. 

This crate is mostly a wrapper for other libraries, unifying existing APIs into a single, cohesive
interface. It serves as **[IconPie's](https://github.com/GarkGarcia/icon-pie)** internal library.

# Overview

An _icon_ consists of a map between _keys_ and _images_. An _entry_ is a _key-value_ pair contained
in an _icon_.

**IconBaker** simply automates the process of re-scaling _images_, creating _entries_ and combining
them into an _icon_.

## Keys

Each _icon_ format is associated with a particular _key type_, which determines how
_entries_ are labeled. Each _key_ can only be associated with a single _image_.

For example, _icon_ formats that only differentiate _entries_ by the dimensions of their associated
_images_ are labeled by _positive integers_, such as the `.ico` and `.icns` file-formats.

On the other hand, _icon_ formats that distinguish their _entries_ by 
_[path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29)_, such as _png sequeces_ and
_[FreeDesktop icon themes](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html)_
, are labeled by _path_.

Note that, since the dimensions
of the _images_ contained in an _entry_ are dictated by their associated _entries_, every _key_
must be convertible to a _positive integers_. Therefore, all _key types_ are required to implement
`AsRef<u32>`.

## Resampling

Pictures are scaled using resampling filters, which are represented by _functions that take a source_ 
_image and a size and return a re-scaled image_.

This allows the users of this crate to provide their custom resampling filters. Common resampling 
filters are provided in the 
[`resample`](https://docs.rs/icon_baker/2.2.0/icon_baker/resample/index.html) module.

# Examples

## General Usage

The `Icon::add_entry` can be used to automatically resample
_source images_ and converts them to _entries_ in an icon.

```rust
use icon_baker::{ico::{Ico, Key}, SourceImage, Icon, Error};
  
fn example() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let icon = Ico::new();
    let src = SourceImage::open("image.svg")?;

    icon.add_entry(resample::linear, &img, Key(32))
}
```

## Writing to Disk

Implementors of the `Icon` trait can be written to any object
that implements `io::Write` with the `Icon::write` method.

```rust
use icon_baker::favicon::Favicon;
use std::{io, fs::File};
 
fn example() -> io::Result<()> {
    let icon = Favicon::new();

    // Process the icon ...

    let file = File::create("out.icns")?;
    icon.write(file)
}
```

Alternatively, icons can be directly written to a file on
disk with `Icon::save` method.

```rust
use icon_baker::favicon::Favicon;
use std::{io, fs::File};
 
fn example() -> io::Result<()> {
    let icon = Favicon::new();

    /* Process the icon */

    icon.save("./output/")
}
```

# Support

## Icon Formats

These are the output formats **IconBaker** natively supports. Be aware that custom output types can 
be created using the [`Icon`](https://docs.rs/icon_baker/2.2.0/icon_baker/trait.Icon.html) trait.

* `ico`
* `icns`
* _favicon_

### Icns Support

**Icon Baker** uses the [`icns`](https://crates.io/crates/icns) crate for generating `.icns` files. The 
supported [icon types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format#Icon_types) are specified 
by the creators of such crate as follows:

## Image Formats

**IconBaker** uses [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image) for _raster graphics_ manipulations and 
[`resvg`](https://crates.io/crates/resvg/0.6.1) with the [`raqote`](https://crates.io/crates/raqote) 
backend for `svg` rasterization. Note that `raqote` requires [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/) to build.
